# Dataset

This `Dataset` folder contains two key files essential for our experiment:

- [**Forest_dataset.ttl**](./Forest_dataset.ttl): This dataset, which has been uploaded to a private SPARQL endpoint, contains comprehensive data used throughout our research.

- [**dataDefinitions.ttl**](./dataDefinitions.ttl): This is a concise file that includes data definitions relevant to our study. It encompasses the naming conventions and descriptions of the sensors used in the dataset. (This is for the RDF Embeddings step)
